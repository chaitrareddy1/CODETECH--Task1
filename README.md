## Project Overview
###Project: Linear regression on California Housing dataset.
###Objecctive:
Linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. Use a dataset California Housing dataset for training and evaluation.
###Key Activities:
Data Loading and Exploration:Import necessary libraries.
Data Preprocessing:Split the data into features (X) and target variable (y).Divide the dataset into training and test sets.
Model Evaluation:Make predictions on the test set.


###Technologies used:
Python:The primary programming language used for data analysis, machine learning, and model implementation.
Pandas:Library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data seamlessly.
NumPy:Library for numerical operations, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Matplotlib:Plotting library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
Seaborn:Statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
Scikit-learn:Machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes modules for data loading, preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.
